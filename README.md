# Titan

A microframework for writing Swift web apps.

## Motivation

The current landscape of Swift web frameworks is vertically integrated. These frameworks are unsuitable for specific microservice environments where very small codebases are the overriding concern.

## What

Titan is an HTTP router with middleware support. It draws heavily on existing codebases to reduce the risk in a production environment.

Titan helps you write functions that receive an HTTP request and produce an HTTP response. It is compatible with Nest and Kitura's `ServerDelegate` protocol. It is optimized for clarity and developer productivity over speed.

Titan is not a web server, and it has very few features. It was architected in one evening at a bar in Germany. It is therefore very well-engineered.

## Examples

...can be found in the `examples` directory.

## Who

A couple of nerds who probably have no business doing this in the first place.
