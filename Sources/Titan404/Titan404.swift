 Returns a 404 response.

 By design, Titan returns a null HTTP response. This is less than ideal.
 by adding this to the top of a chain of Titan functions, the server will return this response if
 no other function has returned a ResponseType. Otherwise, any other function that returns a response will
 effectively overwrite it.
